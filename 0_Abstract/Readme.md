## ABSTRACT
- Over the past two decades, the automotive industry has aggressively researched ways to exploit modern computing and electronic advances in the development of safety, reliability, and entertainment technologies for vehicles. 
- With drivers exposed to an ever increasing number of distractions, automatic rain-sensing wiper systems become an even more appealing feature, as they work to minimize the time the driver must take his/her hands off the wheel.
- Most traditional systems offer intermittent as well as variable speed operation.
- The traditional wiper system however requires driver constant attention in adjusting the wiper speed .
- Traditional windshield wiper speed constantly varies according to time and vehicleâ€™s speed.
- Because the manual adjustment of the wiper distracts driver's attention, which may be a direct cause accidents.
- This is review paper for automatic wier in various method and also explain the basic skeleton for adjust speed of wiper automatically cording to the amount of water on the windshield and in addition with also in advance removal of moisture inside the car while raining. 
- The system activates the wiper to operate in full automatic mode and detect moister using CAN technology.
## KEYWORDS
- Moisture sensor (SH200).
- PIC 18F/16F series.
- Microcontrollers with CAN function provisions.
- temperature sensor.
- moisture sensor.
- rain level sensor.
## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
- We are very happy to see that, we succeeded a project which will be useful for the application being developed in Jonkoping University in co-operation with the company Kongsberg Automotive.
- We would like to take this opportunity to thank our tutor Dr.K.Gouthami for her support and guidance all through the project.
